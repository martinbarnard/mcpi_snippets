Some snippets of minecraft-pi coding examples.


## Exploring the minecraft-pi api

Just snippets really.

- loc_save and loc_load will save locations for you, and teleport you to those.
- tunnel is a quick and dirty tunnel builder.
- recorder and teleport are not really working
- minecraft_box will be a box-maker
- archie_home is a quick script for taking my nephew home.

Have fun & hack away.
